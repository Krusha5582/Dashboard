This project is a student-facing application journey dashboard built for a study-abroad consultancy platform.
It is designed to guide students step-by-step through the entire international admissions lifecycle — from profile evaluation to university enrollment.

The dashboard focuses on clarity, reassurance, and action-driven UX, presenting each stage of the journey with clear status indicators, contextual guidance, and next-step actions. Students can upload documents, submit essays, pay application fees, track university decisions, and communicate directly with their assigned counselor — all from a single, cohesive interface.

Key design principles include:

Progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive overload

Single primary action per stage to maintain focus

Human-centric UX with counselor access and reassurance cues

Enterprise-grade modal flows for transactional actions (uploads, payments, decisions)

The UI is built with React and Tailwind CSS, using a component-driven architecture and state-based rendering to reflect real-time progression across stages. Special attention is given to modal ergonomics, hierarchy, and calm visual rhythm, ensuring that even high-stakes actions (payments, submissions) feel controlled and trustworthy.

Overall, the project prioritizes product thinking over decoration, aiming to feel less like a form-based portal and more like a guided, supportive journey.
